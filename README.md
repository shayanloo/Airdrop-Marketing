# Airdrop Marketing: Active Ethereum (ETH) and Polygon addresses for airdropping NFTs and Tokens
🪂 Airdrop Marketing, List of Active ETH and Polygon addresses for airdropping NFTs and Tokens. 🎁 Giving away free tokens is just the start of your airdrop marketing campaign. You'll be surprised how many projects struggle to fill their crypto airdrop. You're giving away free coins, but the people aren't lining up yet.

📁 I collected more than 🚀 `+1,000,000` active addresses. These addresses are completely real and active. All these addresses have 🌊 OpenSea accounts and are connected to this website. These addresses have bought NFTs at least once, or were active in 🌊 OpenSea for some time and 💎 minted NFTs of various projects.

🎯 If you plan to advertise using airdropping and give away some of your tokens for free, you will need these active addresses. By visiting this website `https://www.rfctools.com/ethereum-address-validator` you can validate the addresses in the `TXT/addresses.txt` file.

✔️ If you need another 💾 format, for example, csv or sql, etc. just Email me `vimoogroup[@]gmail.com` to get the 📁 files, I will send you all the addresses in any format you like. 

> 🔮 Between 2,000 and 5,000 new addresses will be added daily.

> 💾 Available formats: `.txt` | `.csv` | `.sql`
